# Globalization-Defects

This project documents the standard set of categories to classify [Globalization defects](globalization-defects.md).

## Introduction

The GILT Leaders Forum is a self-organized group of seasoned globalization professionals representing various companies from the "buyer" side. The group chartered a Globalization Defects Management Task Force to research and produce standard set of categories to classify globalization defects. By globalization, we refer to internationalization, localization and linguistic issues.

The purpose of this work has been to gather knowledge from G11n Quality experts and transfer it to those responsible for managing quality/defects in their own organizations, or on behalf of others.
